  <h3>Why Beauty And The Beast Is Making<br>A Key Change To Emma Watson's Belle
  </h3>
  <h4>By Adam Holmes

       <p>Next year's Beauty and the Beast will be telling the same tale as its 1991 animated predecessor, but don't think that means it will be an exact duplicate. As with any good remake, there will be certain changes, like new songs, new characters and altered appearances. One of the more interesting changes, however, comes in a clever alteration to the movie's female protagonist, Belle. In addition to remaining a bookworm, the new Beauty and the Beast has also made her an inventor.

  <h3>The Despicable Me 3 Trailer Is Hilarious And Exciting
  </h3>

       <p>Illumination Entertainment dropped the first teaser for Despicable Me 3 this morning, more than likely so that the film's trailer can be attached to Sing during its theatrical release next week. A surprisingly Minion-lite affair, the trailer shows the film's ostentatious new villain making a daring heist, with only some bubble gum, a sonic blaster of some sort, and a we aponized Rubik's Cube. Thankfully, Gru and Lucy are on the case, which leads to the former villain fighting the current baddie, in a match that ends with rather disastrous results.

  <h3>The Most Challenging Part Of Filming Avengers: Infinity War, According To Dave Bautista
  </h3>

       <p>Avengers: Infinity War isn't going to just be another Marvel blockbuster or even just another regular Avengers installment. It's gearing up to be Marvel's biggest cinematic story yet, and quite frankly, one of the biggest blockbusters in Hollywood. Nearly every major Marvel hero introduced over the last decade will be involved in some way, along with a fair number of supporting characters and a few new players being introduced. In other words, Avengers: Infinity War is going to have a gigantic ensemble, and Dave Bautista, a.k.a. Drax the Destroyer, that's going to present some challenges.
